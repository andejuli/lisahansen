            <p>"We love having Lisa come and play the piano! The residents love listening to her talented playing. She lets the residents pick their favorite songs and she will learn how to play them so that they can remember their past. She is very flexible and easy to work with! I would definitely recommend having Lisa come and play for anyone who is looking for a good time."</p>

            <p>"It is my pleasure to recommend Lisa Hansen as a collaborative pianist, classroom teacher, and musician. Ms. Hansen has been a tremendous support to the Department of Music at Brigham Young University Idaho for many years. I have had the privilege of working with her in the vocal/choral area. She has been a great colleague. As a pianist, Lisa is versatile and acquainted with many styles of music. She has capably taught private piano lessons and group piano classes. She has been highly sought-after to accompany choirs and soloists (both vocal an instrumental) from beginning to advanced levels. She is equally at home in the university and church environments. I have entrusted her with difficult music at short notice and she has always come through."</p>
