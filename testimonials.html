            <p>"We love having Lisa come and play the piano! The residents love listening to her talented playing. She lets the residents pick their favorite songs and she will learn how to play them so that they can remember their past. She is very flexible and easy to work with! I would definitely recommend having Lisa come and play for anyone who is looking for a good time."</p>
